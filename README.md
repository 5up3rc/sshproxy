sshproxy
========

Golang library to proxy ssh connections



## Why

I'm using this library in a honeypot, using this library I can intercept the ssh connections and connect each connection to their own container.

## Use cases

* capture the flag
* honeypots
* creating screencasts
* whatever you'd like


## Example

```
go run examples/main.go --dest 172.16.84.182:22 --key examples/conf/id_rsa

```
